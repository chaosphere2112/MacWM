I'm tired of moving windows around.  Really, really tired.

I recently set up Awesome on my Debian computer.  It's awesome.  It
takes care of all of the crap (read: window management) that I had to do
all day long, wasting my time and energy keeping windows in usable positions.

I rapidly grew to hate using my Mac for any real development, except that...
it's the only place I can use Xcode, and I just started iOS development.

So, at an impasse, I came up with the idea of using AppleScript to keep my
windows in line.  Some quick googling found an application called
FastScripts(www.red-sweater.com/fastscripts), which supports binding applescripts
to keys commands.  I personnaly keep mine set up like this:

option-w: Full Screen
option-q: Tile Current Application
option-a: Tile all apps, dock current app on left
option-s: Tile all apps
option-d: Tile all apps, dock current app on right.

There are a couple of issues with the scripts right now:
	- Carbon support
	- Java support (Same issue?)

Older applications (or Eclipse, or Spotify) spit out an error dialog, but everything
up to those will tile properly.

Hope you enjoy these, and please, feel free to update them!
